# V3 Saving Scheme

V3 keeps the existing readable folder style while making each saved object fit
one of three roles.

## Saved Object Types

```text
generated starting state -> one-frame GSD + creation metadata HDF5
evolved run              -> trajectory GSD + log HDF5 + optional final GSD
summary/search table     -> CSV or Parquet
```

## Folder Roots

These roots are defined in `md_Helpers.Project_Paths`.

```text
Thermalized_States_v3/
Cavitation_States_v3/
Cavitation_Evolved_v3/
Excitation_States_v3/
Excitation_Evolved_v3/
Master_CSVs_v3/
```

## Phase Separation Policy

Run phase-separation classifiers on final states from real dynamics:

```text
Thermalized_States_v3/.../randomization.gsd
Cavitation_Evolved_v3/.../cavitation_final.gsd
Excitation_Evolved_v3/.../excitation_final.gsd
```

Do not classify artificial starting states by default:

```text
Cavitation_States_v3/.../cavitation_initial.gsd
Excitation_States_v3/.../excitation_initial.gsd
```

Those starting states should instead store creation metadata such as removed
particle count, selected particle count, altered velocities, injected energy,
and parent-state paths.

## Migration

Use `V3_Migrate_Saved_Files.ipynb` from the repository root. Start with
`DRY_RUN = True`, review the migration plan, then rerun with `DRY_RUN = False`.
